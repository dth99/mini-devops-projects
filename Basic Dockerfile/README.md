Here's your polished `README.md` for the **Hello Captain - Dockerfile Project**:

---

# 🐳 Hello, Captain! — Dockerfile Project

In this project, you will write a basic **Dockerfile** to create a lightweight Docker image. When the container runs, it should simply print:

> **"Hello, Captain!"**

This is a great beginner-friendly exercise to get started with Docker and understand how to create custom images using Dockerfiles.

---

## 📋 Requirements

* The Dockerfile should be named **`Dockerfile`**.
* The Dockerfile should be located in the **root** directory of the project.
* Use **`alpine:latest`** as the base image.
* The image should print **“Hello, Captain!”** to the console and then exit.
